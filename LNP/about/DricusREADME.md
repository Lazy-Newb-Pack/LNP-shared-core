1. INTRODUCTION

Lazy Newb Pack (LNP) was originally created by LucasUP. It's a nice and easy
launcher for Dwarf Fortress. On top of that the pack includes the most popular
tools available for Dwarf Fortress.

Ever since I started using LNP, I wanted to make a cross platform version of it,
so when I noticed that LucasUP made LNP open source, I immediately started
coding.
