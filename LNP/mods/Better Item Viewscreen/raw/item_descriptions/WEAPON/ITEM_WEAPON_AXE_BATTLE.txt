A battle axe is an edge weapon that is essentially a sharp blade
mounted perpendicularly on the end of a handle.

Dwarves can forge battle axes out of any weapon-grade metal, 
though those with superior edge properties are more effective.
A battle axe may also be used as a tool for chopping down trees.
