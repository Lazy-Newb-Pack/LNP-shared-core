LNP-shared-core
===============

Components of the Dwarf Fortress LNP that can be used on any OS.

The goal of this project is to create a canonical common base for different versions of the Lazy Newb Pack, across whatever platform or variant a user or pack maintainer feels like.  It assumes that the pack is based on the [PyLNP launcher]() or an equivalent, and content is currently targeted at DF v0.40.14

It consists of alternative color schemes, standard 'newb friendly' default settings, an embark profile collection, keybindings (alternative control schemes), and miscellaneous "extras" to install.  

As a work in progress, be aware that it's not finished yet and may have odd or conflicting settings!

Contributions, feedback, and reuse all welcome.

TODO:  document source of all components here, with links.
